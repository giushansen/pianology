        <h1>What is the best age to start piano lessons?</h1>
        <h4>The brain</h4>
        <p>Did you know that the brain grows faster in the first 5 years than at any other time in a person's life?</p>
        <p>Language blooms and motor abilities advance. The physical skills that children develop during these first 5 years build on each other to lead new skills. They develop skills the way builders build a house. They need to start with a foundation. And that is also why the more they get to practice the stronger their skill development grows. Hence if children under the age of 5 show an interest in playing the piano should be allowed to explore and learn on their own timetable. </p>
        <h4>What is the best way to teach children under 5? </h4>
        <p>They probably won't respond well to an adult-imposed learning structure. Hence the piano lessons cannot be lasting longer than 30 minutes at this stage until they develop their attention span later on, about 6 - 8 years old. The piano lessons will include pictures and diagrams of piano keys and musical notes and symbols. The main method used will be what we call the ear-based method such as the <a href="http://www.suzukimusic.org.au/suzuki.htm"> Suzuki Method</a>. Piano students who are able to read with more fluency from about 6 years old can use the book based method.  </p>
        <h4>How can Parents help in their children learning to play the piano? </h4>
        <p>By providing their children opportunities to cultivate their general interest in music such as singing, dancing, listening to recorded music and enroling their children in a good music program that helps the child to have fun exploring music and prepare for study in any musical instrument when the time is right. Parents who give their children the gift of musical education start them out in a path that will enrich their lives in so many ways. Studying music develops discipline, hand-eye coordination, intelligence, and creates a skill that can bring happiness to both the performer and to all who listen. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/01/health/la-he-0301-brain-music-20100301">(Read this article in the LA Times).</a></p>
        <h4>So when is your child ready to learn to play the piano? </h4>
        <p>The best time is different for every child. But here is a short summary of what we look out for to have a good start as a piano student: the size of hand, finger independence and interest in music and desire to learn. </p>
