      <h1>The policy</h1>
      <hr>
      <h4>1. The circle of 3 responsibilities to success -</h4>
      <p>The teacher's, the student's, and the parents'. We each have different responsibilities and will work together to achieve successful piano learning for the student. My commitment is to instruct, encourage, and inspire in an environment that is stimulating and fun. I will offer a balanced program of repertoire, theory, sight-reading, ear training and performance opportunities according to suitability.</p>
      <p>The student's responsibility will be to be ready for the lesson at the stipulated time with the materials prepared. A commitment to practicing aided by parents' home encouragement. Daily practice of at least 30 minutes uninterrupted.</p>
      <p>Providing structure by establishing a set time that is honored and protected is the most important thing you can do as parents. Ensure the piano is well maintained and is in an area free of interruptions and distractions. Younger children may need you to actually be with them while they practice to help establish good habits even if you are not musically trained.</p>
      <h4>2. Cancelled lessons and makeup lessons -</h4>
      <p>There are no refunds for missed lessons. It is the student's or parents' responsibility to inform in advance as soon as it is clear the student cannot attend the lesson. Makeups will be offered only if I have been given a 24 hour notice. Emergencies will be handled case-by-case basis. </p>
      <h4>3. Termination of lessons -</h4>
      <p>There will be no refunds for lessons that have already occurred. It is the student's or parents' responsibility to inform as soon as it is clear that termination is required and then refund for the future lessons can be returned.</p>

  <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
  <h5>Free trial lesson</h5>
  <p><bt>One introduction free trial lesson is provided to assess if your child is ready to commence formal piano lessons. Once the readiness is established the lesson plan will be discussed with the parent. If the free trial lesson is not the child's first lesson in learning piano, that is, the child has had previous piano lessons and is already established as learning in progress, the first lesson is also considered a free trial. All first lessons are free.</bt></p>
  <h5>Regular weekly lesson</h5>
  <p><bt>Piano lessons are attended weekly, on the same day each week. A lesson comes in 3 types of duration length of 30 minutes, 45 minutes and 60 minutes according to each individual's suitablity. I do not follow school term holidays. If holiday is planned, please notify as soon as possible so that we can schedule a make up lesson. The makeup lesson may however not be on the same day as your regular lesson. It will be a day when you and the teacher are both available. </a></p>
  <h5>Piano 5</h5>
  <p><bt>Lessons are paid for in 5 lessons in advance. The rate is $30 per half hour. If your lesson length is 30 minutes then the payment will be $150. If your lesson is 45 minutes, then each payment is $225. If your lesson takes 1 hour, then each payement is $300. Payment is made on the first lesson of each 5 lesson.</bt></p>
  <h5>Paymemt methods</h5>
  <p><bt>Payment of each set of 5 lessons is made at every first of the 5 lesson if in cash or cheque. If direct debit is chosen, then the payment should be done by every first lesson date. It is each student or parents' responsibility to pay on time. </bt></p>
  <h5>Punctuality</h5>
  <p><bt>It is both the teacher's and the student's responsibility to be on time, and prepared for the lesson at least 5 minutes before the lesson should occur. If there are any emergencies it should be communicated as soon as possible so that other alternatives may be sought. If the student is late, the full lesson time duration cannot be guaranteed as there might be other students in line after the lesson. If the teacher is late and the lesson cannot be fulfilled to satisfaction, an additional lesson at no cost should be offerred at the availablity of both to makeup for the lost time. </bt></p>
  <h5>Lesson environment</h5>
  <p><bt>It is the commitment of the student and the parents to ensure that the piano lesson is free of distractions and interruptions so that the lesson time is utilized to satisfaction. During the lesson, the environment should be a quiet one and reasonably safe and comfortable. All mobile phones should be silent or switched off.</bt></p>
  <h5>Cancelled lessons and makeup lessons</h5>
  <p><bt>There are no refunds for missed lessons. It is the student's or parents' responsibility to inform in advance as soon as it is clear the student cannot attend the lesson. Makeups will be offered only if I have been given a 24 hour notice. Emergencies will be handled case-by-case basis. </bt></p>
  <h5>Termination of lessons</h5>
  <p><bt>There will be no refunds for lessons that have already occurred. It is the student's or parents' responsibility to inform as soon as it is clear that termination is required and then refund for the future lessons can be returned.</bt></p>
