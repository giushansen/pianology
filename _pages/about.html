        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance. He gets a beautiful heart. " <em>-Shin'ichi Suzuki</em></p>

        <h4>Music History</h4>
        <p>I am a classically trained pianist, thus my first love is the classical repertoire and I am excited to introduce to students this world of expressing music with their own two hands. My father played the guitar and my mother played the piano. It was no surprise that I grew up starting formal piano lessons at age of 4 years old. Both my brothers play the piano and guitar. I also learned to play the violin, viola, flute, piccolo, and guitar. Music was always something I went back to for enjoyment, for comfort, for happiness, and for sadness. </p>
        <h4>Life</h4>
        <p>Besides the piano, my adult career is mainly pediatric nursing, then gerontology nursing, and finally education in nursing. I have been teaching nursing in a big teaching hospital in Sydney, St Vincent's Hospital the last 14 years of my life. Recently relocating to Perth due to my husband's work, I am currently completing my AMEB Grades and Diploma in Music. Seeing my children learn piano and being able to teach other children have helped me grow as a teacher and realize that it is true music lives in everyone. Whether or not the people I teach now although are learning well continue to play professionally or for enjoyment, I have the pleasure of satisfaction knowing I have started the music seed. </p>
        <h4>Family</h4>
        <p>Married with kids of my own who are also learning music has also helped me understand the curiosity of parents who are hoping to introduce music into their children's lives.</p>
        <h4>Other Interests</h4>
        <p>Music and arts are my greatest interests, where music is the only thing I have progressed professionally with. I speak 3 languages - English, French, and Mandarin. I also love sailing and all other water sports, skiing, and outdoor activities such as camping.</p>

    <h4>THE THINKING</h4>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
