        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Your reward will be the ability not only to express music with your own two hands but also to mold your entire life into an art form of its own" <em>-Seymour Bernstein</em></p>

        <h4>Music History</h4>
        <p>I am a classically trained pianist, thus my first love is the classical repertoire and I am excited to introduce to students this world of expressing music with their own two hands. My father played the guitar and my mother played the piano. It was no surprise that I grew up starting formal piano lessons at age of 4 years old. Both my brothers play the piano and guitar. I also learned to play the violin, viola, flute, piccolo, and guitar. Music was always something I went back to for enjoyment, for comfort, for happiness, and for sadness. </p>
        <h4>Life</h4>
        <p>Besides the piano, my adult career is mainly pediatric nursing, then gerontology nursing, and finally education in nursing. I have been teaching nursing in a big teaching hospital in Sydney, St Vincent's Hospital the last 14 years of my life. Recently relocating to Perth due to my husband's work, I have found myself organizing my piano exams to complete AMEB Grade 8 and Diploma in Music and wanting to continue to upgrade my knowledge in piano and music. It is never too late to keep music in your life. Seeing my kids learn piano and being able to teach other kids have helped me grow as a teacher and realize that it is true music lives in everyone. Whether or not the people I teach now although are learning well continue to play professionally or for enjoyment, I have the pleasure of satisfaction knowing I have started the music seed. </p>
        <h4>Family</h4>
        <p>Married in 2011, we have 2 kids now aged 2 and 4. The younger a boy and the older a girl. My older girl is constantly inquisitive as you would have at this age, and is always asking questions and asking the word "why?". She loves coloring, being read to, and just talking about everything. She has a few close friends whom we try to get together with regularly through school and church. Our little boy is starting to learn how to be sociable among other children his age and is discovering that in this life, sharing and caring is very important. He doesn't always get his way and that is the challenge we as parents are trying to bring across to him as kindly and caring as possible.</p>
        <h4>Other Interests</h4>
        <p>Music and arts are my greatest interests, where music is the only thing I have progressed professionally with. I speak 3 languages - English, French, and Mandarin. I also love sailing and all other water sports, skiing, and outdoor activities such as camping.</p>

    <h4>THE THINKING</h4>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
